# Minecraft-With-Mods
A simple modpack for my friends

Prismlauncher should just let you install the mods as a zip.

If you don't have minecraft, repalce the accounts.json in the launcher with this one. When it asks to sign in, press 'Create an account' and then press 'OK' without touching anything. The game should launch (Download a prismlauncher version below 9.0 if it doesn't.)

The accounts.json is at:

Windows: Press Win+R and write "%appdata%\PrismLauncher"
MacOS: Navigate to "~/Library/Application Support/PrismLauncher"
Linux (Base Package): Navigate to "~/.local/share/PrismLauncher"
Linux (Flatpak): Navigate to "~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher"
